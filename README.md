# MathsPrompt

A simple tool that schedules maths problems to be solved.

## Input Questions

For the initial input of basis questions, spin up the Rust server from the base
directory with a simple `cargo run`. This will start the server on port 8000.

Then, navigate to `localhost:8000` in your browser and enter the questions you
want. (You'll want to update the hardcoded `database_url` in the `src/main.rs` file.)

## Question Variant Autogeneration

When a question is successfully input into the Postgres database, the server
then queries the OpenAI API to generate a number of variants of the question.
These are then inserted into the database as well (with a label to indicate that
they have been autogenerated).
